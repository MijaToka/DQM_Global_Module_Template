  This project creates the DQM global template used for
  positioning the modules in the HGCal DQM.


  It consists of a python script which reads a ModMap from
  HGCal Integrations ModMap project, and generates a ROOT
  file which is used in the DQM for HGCal.


  The input files are organized in the Gemoetry subdirectory
  by version (note the file name also reflects the version),
  and the output files are generated in the outputs
  subdirectory organized by version as well.
